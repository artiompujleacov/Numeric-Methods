This was the first homework for the "Numeric Methods" course(I attached the 
pdf with the condition). The idea was to solve 3 different tasks using 
functions based on the methods learned int the numeric methods course.
The first task was about a labirinth,finding the probability of getting out
by choosing a random direction at each step.And then to find the shortest path
to get out of the labirinth,by implementing greedy algorithm.
The second task was about linear regression.The purpouse was to predict the 
prices apartments(based on the story given).And every apartment had 2 or more
characteristics,so there was a way to find a difference in the prices,
The third task was to classify decimal numbers handwritten on a photo of 400
pixels(20x20).The training set was given and the task was to find the best
optimized algorithms for linear regression.
